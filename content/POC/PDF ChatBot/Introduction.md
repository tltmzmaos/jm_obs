# Overview
I want to create a project that answers questions based on uploaded PDF files or PDF URLs. There may be various methods, but by going through trial and error, I can discover my own unique approach and compare it with those of others who have already created similar projects, learning from the process. Though I'm not sure how long it will take, I plan to work on it gradually after work hours.

Many documents are managed in PDF format, and I also have some book lists provided as PDF files from purchases. It occurred to me that a system to answer questions about these books could be helpful in the future. Therefore, I aim to undertake this project to see if it can benefit me as well.
